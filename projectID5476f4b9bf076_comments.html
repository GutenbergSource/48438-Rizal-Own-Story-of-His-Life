<HTML><BODY>This little book, intended for use in schools, and published in 1918 by the American authorities in the Philippines, was part of the program to promote Jose Rizal as the national hero of the Philippines.

<p>It includes a translation of Rizal's childhood memories and other autographical fragments as wel as the story of Mariang Makiling, published by him and referenced to in his main novel, <i>Noli me Tangere</i> (chapter 20). The booklet is richly illustrated (although using newsprint).

<p>Have fun!</BODY></HTML>
